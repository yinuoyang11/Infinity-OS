RTC:
symptom: OS kept restarting when entering
error: no critical section in the rtc handler
fix: add sti() at the start of the rtc handler and cli() at the end.
difficulty: 30 min

IDT:
1.symptom: OS kept restarting when entering
error: inversed idt index for rtc and keyboard

difficulty: 60 min

error: set the reversed3 field of systemcall interrupt descriptor to 0 (which means interrupt gate)
fix: set the reversed3 field of systemcall interrupt descriptor to 1 (which means trap gate)
difficulty: 60 min

SYSTEM CALLS (READ, OPEN):
symptom: unable to compile due to complex struct web
error: filesystem.h object "operations" included another object which itself included "operations" object (infinite loop)
fix: get current pcb in the smaller level read/open functions so the smaller level functions can take in fd index
     instead of fd object as an argument. Before, the operations object would have function pointers that would take in 
     fd objects which had an operations struct argument (infinite loop)
     
Vidmap:

FILESYSTEM:
symptom: calling "cat verylarge..." would print the correct content but also frame0.txt data directly afterward
